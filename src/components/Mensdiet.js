                <h2> 1. Nutrients to Prioritize</h2>

                <h3>Iron</h3>
                <h4>Heavy menstrual bleeding can deplete your body’s iron stores, leading to fatigue, weakness, and dizziness.</h4>
                    <h3>Sources:</h3><h4>Lean meats (chicken, beef, turkey), fish (salmon, tuna), beans, lentils, leafy greens (spinach, kale), tofu, eggs, and fortified cereals.</h4>
                    <h3>Tip: </h3><h4>To boost iron absorption, pair these foods with vitamin Crich foods like citrus fruits, bell peppers, or tomatoes.</h4>

                    <h3> Magnesium</h3>
                    <h4>Magnesium is essential for muscle relaxation and can help alleviate cramps and headaches.</h4>
                    <h3>Sources:</h3><h4>  Nuts (almonds, cashews), seeds (pumpkin, sunflower), leafy greens, whole grains (brown rice, oats), and dark chocolate.</h4> 
                    <h3>Tip:</h3><h4>  Magnesium also helps to regulate serotonin, which can help improve mood and reduce anxiety during periods.</h4> 

                    <h3>  Calcium</h3>
                  <h4> Calcium helps reduce menstrual cramps by maintaining muscle tone and fluid balance. It also aids in mood regulation.</h4> 
                   <h3> Sources: </h3><h4>Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese), calciumfortified plantbased milk (soy, almond), leafy greens (bok choy, broccoli), and tofu.</h4> 

                <h3> Vitamin B6</h3>
                <h4>This vitamin can help reduce bloating, irritability, and breast tenderness by regulating hormonal changes.</h4>
                <h3>Sources: </h3> <h4>Poultry, fish, potatoes, bananas, chickpeas, oatmeal, and sunflower seeds.</h4>

                <h3> Omega3 Fatty Acids</h3>
                <h4>Omega3s have antiinflammatory properties that reduce menstrual cramps, bloating, and pain.</h4>
                <h3> Sources: </h3><h4>Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and hemp seeds.</h4>

                <h3> Fiber</h3>
                <h4> Fiber aids digestion and helps prevent constipation, which can worsen bloating during your period. It also helps balance hormones by regulating estrogen levels.</h4>
                <h3> Sources: </h3><h4> Whole grains (brown rice, oats, quinoa), legumes (beans, lentils), fruits (apples, pears, berries), and vegetables (broccoli, carrots, spinach).</h4>

                <h3>Potassium</h3>
                <h4> Potassium helps reduce bloating and fluid retention by balancing sodium levels in the body.</h4>
                <h3>Sources: </h3> <h4>Bananas, avocados, sweet potatoes, leafy greens, and tomatoes.</h4>

                <h3>  Water</h3>
                <h4>Staying hydrated is crucial during menstruation, as it helps prevent bloating, reduces headaches, and supports energy levels.</h4>
                <h3> Tip: </h3><h4>In addition to water, consume waterrich foods like cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, and soups.</h4>
