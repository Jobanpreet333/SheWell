        <h1>Contraceptives</h1>
       <h4>Contraceptives are methods or devices used to prevent pregnancy. They can be hormonal, barrier, or natural, and understanding their types and functions is essential for informed family planning.</h4>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. What are Contraceptives?</h2>
       <h4>Contraceptives are measures taken to prevent pregnancy during sexual intercourse. They work by interfering with the normal process of ovulation, fertilization, or implantation. Various contraceptive methods are available, each with different mechanisms of action, effectiveness, and side effects.</h4>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Types of Contraceptives</h2>

        <h3>a. Hormonal Contraceptives</h3>
       <h4>These contraceptives release hormones to prevent ovulation and create changes in the reproductive system:</h4>
        <ul>
            <h4><li><strong>Birth Control Pills:</strong> Oral contraceptives containing estrogen and progestin, taken daily to prevent ovulation.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Contraceptive Patch:</strong> A small patch worn on the skin that releases hormones to prevent ovulation.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Vaginal Ring:</strong> A flexible ring inserted into the vagina, releasing hormones for three weeks.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Injectable Contraceptives:</strong> Hormonal injections (like Depo-Provera) that prevent ovulation for up to three months.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Implant:</strong> A small rod implanted under the skin of the arm, releasing hormones for up to three years.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>IUDs with Hormones:</strong> Intrauterine devices that release hormones to prevent pregnancy for several years.</li></h4>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Barrier Methods</h3>
       <h4>These methods physically block sperm from reaching the egg:</h4>
        <ul>
            <h4><li><strong>Condoms:</strong> Thin sheaths worn on the penis (male condoms) or inserted into the vagina (female condoms) to prevent sperm entry.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Diaphragm:</strong> A dome-shaped cup inserted into the vagina before intercourse, covering the cervix.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Cervical Cap:</strong> A small cup that fits tightly over the cervix to prevent sperm from entering.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Spermicides:</strong> Chemical agents inserted into the vagina that kill sperm; often used with barrier methods for increased effectiveness.</li></h4>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)</h3>
       <h4>IUDs are small, T-shaped devices inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. They can be hormonal or non-hormonal (copper). IUDs can provide long-term protection, typically lasting several years.</h4>

        <h3>d. Natural Methods</h3>
       <h4>These methods involve tracking fertility signals to avoid unprotected intercourse during fertile periods:</h4>
        <ul>
            <h4><li><strong>Fertility Awareness:</strong> Monitoring menstrual cycles, basal body temperature, and cervical mucus to predict ovulation.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Withdrawal Method:</strong> The male partner withdraws before ejaculation to prevent sperm from entering the vagina.</li></h4>
        </ul>

        <h3>e. Permanent Methods</h3>
       <h4>These methods are surgical procedures intended to provide permanent contraception:</h4>
        <ul>
            <h4><li><strong>Female Sterilization:</strong> Surgical procedures like tubal ligation that block or seal the fallopian tubes.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Male Sterilization:</strong> A vasectomy, where the vas deferens is cut and sealed to prevent sperm from mixing with semen.</li></h4>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>3. Effectiveness of Contraceptives</h2>
       <h4>The effectiveness of contraceptives varies by method. Here's a general overview of typical use effectiveness rates:</h4>
        <ul>
            <h4><li><strong>Birth Control Pills:</strong> 91% effective</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Condoms:</strong> 85% effective</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>IUDs:</strong> 99% effective</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Implants:</strong> 99% effective</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Injectable Contraceptives:</strong> 94% effective</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Fertility Awareness:</strong> 76-88% effective</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Withdrawal Method:</strong> 78% effective</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Surgical Sterilization:</strong> Over 99% effective</li></h4>
        </ul>
