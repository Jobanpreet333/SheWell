       <h4>This document provides a comprehensive overview of abortion, covering its types, medical and surgical methods, legal considerations, emotional aspects, and commonly asked questions.</h4>

    <section>
        <h2>1. What is Abortion?</h2>
       <h4>Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removing or expelling an embryo or fetus from the uterus before it can survive independently. It can be a personal, medical, or necessary decision made for various reasons, including health risks, personal choice, or unplanned pregnancy.</h4>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Types of Abortion</h2>
       <h4>There are two main types of abortion:</h4>
        <ul>
           <h4><li><strong>Spontaneous Abortion (Miscarriage):</strong> A naturally occurring pregnancy loss without medical intervention, typically due to genetic issues or health complications.</li></h4>
           <h4><li><strong>Induced Abortion:</strong> A deliberate intervention to end the pregnancy, which can be carried out for medical, social, or personal reasons.</li></h4>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Methods of Induced Abortion</h2>
       <h4>Induced abortion can be performed through either medical or surgical methods, depending on the stage of pregnancy and other health considerations:</h4>
        
        <h3>3.1 Medical Abortion</h3>
       <h4>Medical abortion involves the use of medications to terminate a pregnancy and is typically done within the first 10 weeks:</h4>
        <ul>
           <h4><li><strong>Mifepristone and Misoprostol:</strong> Taken in sequence, these medications block pregnancy hormones and cause uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy tissue.</li></h4>
           <h4><li><strong>Misoprostol Alone:</strong> In some cases, misoprostol is used alone to induce uterine contractions and complete the abortion process.</li></h4>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Surgical Abortion</h3>
       <h4>Surgical abortion involves a medical procedure to remove the pregnancy from the uterus and may be recommended beyond the first trimester:</h4>
        <ul>
           <h4><li><strong>Vacuum Aspiration:</strong> Suction is used to empty the contents of the uterus. This is commonly performed in the first trimester.</li></h4>
           <h4><li><strong>Dilation and Evacuation (D&E):</strong> A combination of suction and medical instruments is used to remove pregnancy tissue. Typically performed in the second trimester.</li></h4>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Legal Considerations</h2>
       <h4>Abortion laws vary significantly across different regions and may involve specific timeframes, health conditions, or consent requirements. It is essential to consult local laws or speak with a healthcare provider to understand the legal framework governing abortion in your area.</h4>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Emotional and Psychological Aspects</h2>
       <h4>Abortion can be an emotionally complex experience. Feelings may range from relief to sadness, and emotional responses are highly individual. Support from counselors, family, or support groups can be beneficial for those navigating these emotions.</h4>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
