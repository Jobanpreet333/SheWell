        <h4><strong>Eligibility:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <h4><li>Pregnancy may be terminated if there is risk to the life or health of the mother, severe fetal abnormalities, or in cases of rape or contraceptive failure.</li></h4>
            <h4><li>Consent is essential. Minors require guardian consent.</li></h4>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <h4><li>MTP is generally allowed up to 20 weeks, with extensions up to 24 weeks in special cases.</li></h4>
            <h4><li>Beyond these limits, approval from a medical board is often required for life-threatening conditions or severe fetal abnormalities.</li></h4>
        </ul>
