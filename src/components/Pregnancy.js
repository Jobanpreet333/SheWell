        <h2>1. How Pregnancy Occurs</h2>
       <h4>Pregnancy occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg, leading to the development of an embryo. The key stages include:</h4>
        <ul>
            <h4><li><strong>Ovulation:</strong> An egg is released from the ovary and is available for fertilization.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> The sperm penetrates the egg, forming a zygote.</li></h4>
            <h4><li><strong>Implantation:</strong> The zygote travels to the uterus, where it implants into the uterine lining, beginning the pregnancy.</li></h4>
        </ul>
       <h4>Pregnancy is typically measured in weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), with a typical duration of about 40 weeks.</h4>
    </section>
