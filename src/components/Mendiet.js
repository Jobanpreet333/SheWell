    Diet during periods plays a significant role in managing symptoms like cramps, fatigue, bloating, and mood swings. The right foods can help ease discomfort, regulate energy levels, and support overall hormonal balance. Hereâ€™s a guide to foods that are beneficial during menstruation, as well as those to avoid:

### Best Foods to Eat During Periods

1. **Iron-Rich Foods**
   - **Why**: Menstruation leads to blood loss, which can reduce iron levels and cause fatigue, dizziness, or weakness. Increasing iron intake helps replenish lost iron.
   - **Foods**: 
     - Lean meats (chicken, turkey, beef)
     - Leafy greens (spinach, kale, swiss chard)
     - Lentils, beans, chickpeas
     - Tofu
     - Quinoa
     - Fortified cereals
   - **Tip**: Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources (like citrus fruits) to enhance iron absorption.

2. **Magnesium-Rich Foods**
   - **Why**: Magnesium helps relieve cramps by relaxing muscles and reducing inflammation. It can also help with mood swings by regulating serotonin levels.
   - **Foods**: 
     - Dark chocolate (preferably 70% or higher)
     - Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
     - Almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds
     - Avocados
     - Bananas
     - Whole grains
     - Beans and lentils

3. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**
   - **Why**: Omega-3s have anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) and alleviate cramps.
   - **Foods**: 
     - Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines)
     - Chia seeds
     - Flaxseeds
     - Walnuts
     - Fish oil supplements

4. **Complex Carbohydrates**
   - **Why**: Complex carbs stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing cravings and mood swings.

     - Whole wheat bread
     - Legumes (beans, lentils)
     - Barley
   - **Tip**: Choose whole, unprocessed grains for sustained energy.

5. **Calcium-Rich Foods**
   - **Why**: Calcium can reduce bloating, water retention, and mood swings by regulating muscle function and fluid balance.
   - **Foods**:
     - Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese)
     - Leafy greens (collard greens, bok choy)
     - Almonds
     - Fortified plant-based milks (almond, soy)
     - Tofu
     - Sardines and salmon with bones

6. **Vitamin B6-Rich Foods**
   - **Why**: Vitamin B6 helps manage irritability, fatigue, and mood swings by supporting neurotransmitter function and balancing hormones.
   - **Foods**:
     - Bananas
     - Potatoes
     - Chicken, turkey
     - Sunflower seeds
     - Spinach

   - **Foods**:
     - Water
     - Cucumber
     - Watermelon
     - Celery
     - Oranges
   - **Tip**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help flush out excess sodium and ease bloating.

8. **Herbal Teas**
   - **Why**: Certain herbal teas can soothe menstrual cramps and relax muscles.
   - **Best Teas**:
     - **Ginger tea**: Anti-inflammatory and helps with nausea.
     - **Chamomile tea**: Eases cramps and promotes relaxation.
